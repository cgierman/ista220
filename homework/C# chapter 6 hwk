1. error-handling logic

1. if none of the statements generates an exception, they all run, one after the other, to completion.

1. If the calling method does not use a try block or if there is no matching catch handler, the calling method immediately exits, and execution returns to its caller, where the process is repeated. If a matching catch handler is eventually found, the handler runs and execution continues with the first statement that follows the catch handler in the catching method.

1. after cascading back through the list of calling methods, the runtime is unable to find a matching catch handler, the program will terminate with an unhandled exception.

1. SystemException is itself a member of a wider family simply called Exception, and this is the greatgranddaddy of all exceptions. If you catch Exception, the handler traps every possible exception that can occur.

1. catchErrors	boolean	variable?

1. it see if the string is a integer

1. 2,147,483,648	to	2,147,483,647.

1. 0 to 4,294,967,295. An unsigned variable type of int can hold zero and positive numbers, and a signed int holds negative, zero and positive numbers. NO, If negative numbers are involved, the int must be signed; an unsigned int cannot represent a negative number.

1. always be run, even if an exception occurs.

1. i dont know?
