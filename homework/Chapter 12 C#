1. Inheritance in programming is all about classification—it’s a relationship between classes.

1. class DerivedClass : BaseClass

1. System.Object class

1. If you don’t provide one, the compiler generates a default constructor for you

1. no,

1. No, because they would have to be the same instance.

1. If a base class and a derived class happen to declare two methods that have the same signature, you will receive a warning when you compile the application.

1. want the two methods to have the same signature

1. A method that is intended to be overridden is called a virtual method. 

1. Overriding a method is a mechanism for providing different implementations of the same method—the methods are all related because they are intended to perform the same task, but in a class-specific manner.

1. You define an extension method in a static class and specify the type to which the method applies as the first parameter to the method, along with the this keyword.

1. you can extend an existing type (a class or structure) with additional static methods. 

1. The Liskov Substitution Principle says that the object of a derived class should be able to replace an object of the base class without bringing any errors in the system or modifying the behavior of the base class.
